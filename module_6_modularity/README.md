## Lesson 1: Review of Polynomial Commitment Scheme (PCS) Responsibilities

### 1.1 Abstract Interface of PCS

In Module 0, we treated PCS as a black box. Now let's clarify its interface:

**Setup(1^λ, d) → SRS**
- Input: Security parameter λ, maximum polynomial degree d
- Output: Structured Reference String SRS

**Commit(SRS, f(X)) → C**
- Input: Polynomial f(X)
- Output: Commitment C (short "fingerprint")

**Open(SRS, f(X), z, y, C) → π**
- Input: Polynomial, evaluation point z, claimed value y, commitment C
- Output: Opening proof π
- Claim: f(z) = y

**Verify(SRS, C, z, y, π) → accept/reject**
- Verify validity of opening proof

### 1.2 Security Requirements

**Binding**:
- Cannot produce two different valid openings for the same commitment
- Mathematically: Finding (z, y₁, π₁) and (z, y₂, π₂) where y₁ ≠ y₂ both pass verification

**Hiding**:
- Commitment reveals no information about the polynomial
- Usually achieved by adding random polynomials

**Knowledge Extraction**:
- If one can generate valid proofs, must "know" the corresponding polynomial

### 1.3 Efficiency Metrics

**Commitment Size**: Ideally constant size
**Proof Size**: Ideally constant size  
**Verification Time**: Ideally constant time
**Prover Time**: Should be practically feasible

## Lesson 2: In-depth Analysis of KZG Commitment Scheme

### 2.1 Mathematical Foundation of KZG

**Bilinear Pairings**:
- Groups G₁, G₂, G_T
- Pairing function e: G₁ × G₂ → G_T
- Property: e(g^a, h^b) = e(g, h)^(ab)

**Trusted Setup**:
- Choose random number τ (then destroy)
- Compute SRS = {g^(τⁱ)}ᵢ₌₀^d and {h^(τⁱ)}ᵢ₌₀^d

### 2.2 How KZG Works

**Commitment Phase**:
For polynomial f(X) = a₀ + a₁X + ... + aₐXᵈ:
```
C = g^(f(τ)) = g^(a₀ + a₁τ + ... + aₐτᵈ) = ∏ᵢ (g^(τⁱ))^(aᵢ)
```

**Opening Phase**:
To prove f(z) = y, construct quotient polynomial:
```
q(X) = (f(X) - y) / (X - z)
```

Proof π = g^(q(τ))

**Verification Phase**:
Check pairing equation:
```
e(C / g^y, h) = e(π, h^τ / h^z)
```

### 2.3 Advantages of KZG

**Extremely Small Proof Size**:
- Commitment: 1 group element
- Proof: 1 group element
- Total about 64 bytes (using BN254 curve)

**Fast Verification**:
- 2 pairing operations
- About 2-3 milliseconds

**Mature Ecosystem**:
- Wide range of implementations and optimizations
- Hardware acceleration support

### 2.4 Disadvantages of KZG

**Trusted Setup Requirement**:
- Requires one-time ceremony
- If setup is compromised, entire system is insecure
- Different circuit sizes need different setups

**Not Quantum-Safe**:
- Based on discrete logarithm assumption
- Quantum computers can break this

## Lesson 3: Detailed Explanation of FRI Commitment Scheme

### 3.1 Design Philosophy of FRI

**Transparency**:
- No trusted setup required
- All parameters are publicly verifiable
- Based on hash function security

**Quantum Resistance**:
- Based on collision-resistant hash functions
- Resistant to quantum attacks

### 3.2 Background of Reed-Solomon Codes

**Reed-Solomon Codes**:
- Polynomial evaluation form encoding
- For degree-d polynomial, evaluate at n > d points
- Can tolerate up to (n-d)/2 errors

**Distance Property**:
- Two different degree-d polynomials agree on at most d points
- At random points, probability of different polynomials being equal is small

### 3.3 FRI Protocol Overview

**Goal**: Prove that committed function is a low-degree polynomial

**Core Idea**:
- If f(X) is degree-d polynomial
- Then g(X) = (f(X) + f(-X))/2 is degree-d/2 polynomial
- Apply this reduction recursively

**Verification Strategy**:
- Check reduction relation at random points
- Finally reduce to constant polynomial

### 3.4 Detailed FRI Steps

**Reduction Phase**:
```
f₀(X) = f(X)         // degree d₀
f₁(X) = (f₀(X) + f₀(-X))/2 + α₁(f₀(X) - f₀(-X))/(2X)  // degree d₁ = d₀/2
f₂(X) = (f₁(X) + f₁(-X))/2 + α₂(f₁(X) - f₁(-X))/(2X)  // degree d₂ = d₁/2
...
```

**Commitment Phase**:
Evaluate each fᵢ(X) on evaluation domain and commit its Merkle tree

**Query Phase**:
Verifier randomly selects query points, Prover provides consistency proofs

## Lesson 4: PLONK + FRI Combination

### 4.2 Protocol Modifications

**Original PLONK + KZG flow**:

**PLONK + FRI flow**:
1. Evaluate all polynomials on evaluation domain
2. Merkle commit to evaluation values
3. Use FRI to prove these evaluations come from low-degree polynomials
4. Query evaluation values at random points and provide Merkle proofs

### 4.3 Plonky2's Innovations

|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Proof Size | ~200 bytes | ~100 KB |
| Verification Time | ~10 ms | ~100 ms |
| Trusted Setup | Required | Not Required |
| Quantum Safety | No | Yes |
| Prover Time | Faster | Medium |
