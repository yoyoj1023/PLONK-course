# Module 5: Performance Turbo - Using Lookup Tables (Lookup Arguments)

## Module Objective
Learn a key optimization of PLONK to handle complex operations at extremely low cost.

## Mental Model
Instead of laboriously computing `sin(x)` in the circuit, why not directly look up a pre-computed "trigonometric function table."

## Lesson 1: Challenges of SNARK-unfriendly Operations

### 1.1 What is SNARK-unfriendly?

Certain operations are extremely expensive in traditional circuits:

**Range Checks**:
- Problem: Verify if x is in range [0, 2^16)
- Naive method: Decompose into 16 binary bits, requires 16 boolean constraints
- Cost: Each range check needs 16 gates

**Bitwise Operations**:
- Problem: Compute a AND b, a XOR b, etc.
- Naive method: Decompose to bit-level operations
- Cost: 32-bit operations need 32 gates

**Division Operations**:
- Problem: Compute a / b (integer division)
- Naive method: Use multiplication and range checks
- Cost: Very high, requires multiple rounds of interaction

### 1.2 Cost Analysis

Consider a simple range check:

```
Traditional method:
- Decompose x = b₀ + 2b₁ + 4b₂ + ... + 2^15·b₁₅
- Each bᵢ needs boolean constraint: bᵢ(bᵢ-1) = 0
- Total: 16 gates + additional addition gates
```

**Problem**: For complex applications (like zkEVM), such costs are unbearable.

### 1.3 Intuitive Idea of Lookup Tables

**New Approach**: Pre-compute a "valid values table," prove that used values are all in the table.

```
Range table T = [0, 1, 2, 3, ..., 65535]
Lookup values L = [x₁, x₂, x₃, ...]

Prove: Each value in L appears in T
```

---

## Lesson 2: Plookup Protocol Intuition

### 2.1 Core Idea

**Plookup Claim**: "The values I used in my computation can all be found in a predefined table"

**Mathematical Statement**:
- Table T = [t₁, t₂, ..., tₙ]
- Lookup values L = [l₁, l₂, ..., lₘ]  
- Goal: Prove L ⊆ T (L is a subset of T)

### 2.2 Challenge of Subset Checking

**Naive Method**: For each lᵢ, find corresponding tⱼ such that lᵢ = tⱼ
- Problem: Requires m×n comparisons
- Complexity: O(mn)

**Better Method**: Use permutation argument techniques!

### 2.3 Extension of Permutation Arguments

**Core Insight**: Subset relationships can be transformed into permutation relationships

If L ⊆ T, then there exists an "extended L" that is a permutation of T.

**Construction Method**:
```
T = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
L = [2, 4, 2]
Extended L' = [2, 4, 2, 1, 3, 5] (add elements from T not looked up)
```

Now L' is a permutation of T!

## Lesson 3: How Plookup Works

### 3.1 Algorithm Steps

**Step 1**: Sorting
- Sort T and L separately: T_sorted, L_sorted
- If L ⊆ T, then L_sorted can be "merged" into T_sorted

**Step 2**: Merge Check
- Construct merged sequence F
- F should contain all elements of T_sorted, plus all elements of L_sorted
- Length of F = |T| + |L|

**Step 3**: Consistency Verification
- Verify F is correct merge of T_sorted and L_sorted
- Use permutation argument techniques

### 3.2 Detailed Example

**Table**: T = [5, 1, 3, 2, 4]
**Lookup**: L = [2, 5, 1]

**Sorting**:
- T_sorted = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  
- L_sorted = [1, 2, 5]

**Merging**:
- F = [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5]
- Each table element appears once, each lookup element appears additionally once

### 3.3 Merge Verification

**Consistency Checks**:
1. First |L| elements of F should be a permutation of L_sorted
2. Last |T| elements of F should be a permutation of T_sorted  
3. F is a non-decreasing sequence

This can be expressed with polynomial constraints!

## Lesson 4: Polynomial Implementation

### 4.1 Polynomial Representation

Transform sequences into polynomials:
- F(X): interpolates merged sequence
- T_sorted(X): interpolates sorted table
- L_sorted(X): interpolates sorted lookup values

### 4.2 Difference Constraints

**Non-decreasing Check**:
For adjacent elements, F(ωⁱ⁺¹) - F(ωⁱ) ≥ 0

**Polynomial Constraint**:
```
(F(ωX) - F(X)) × (F(ωX) - F(X) - 1) = 0
```

This ensures the difference is either 0 (equal) or 1 (increment by 1).

### 4.3 Permutation Constraints

Use PLONK-like permutation arguments:
- Verify first half of F is a permutation of L_sorted
- Verify second half of F is a permutation of T_sorted

### 4.4 Random Linear Combination

Use random challenge γ:
```
F'(X) = F(X) + γ
T'(X) = T_sorted(X) + γ  
L'(X) = L_sorted(X) + γ
```

Then check product equality.

## Lesson 5: Efficient Table Design

### 5.1 Precomputed Tables

**Range Tables**:
```
T_range = [0, 1, 2, ..., 2^k - 1]
```

**Bitwise Operation Tables**:
```
T_and = [(a, b, a AND b) for a, b in [0, 2^k)]
T_xor = [(a, b, a XOR b) for a, b in [0, 2^k)]
```

**Arithmetic Tables**:
```
T_sqrt = [(x, √x) for x in perfect_squares]
T_log = [(x, log₂(x)) for x in powers_of_2]
```

### 5.2 Multi-dimensional Tables

For complex operations, use multi-column tables:

```
ADD_table = [
    (a, b, a+b) for a, b in [0, 2^8) 
    if a + b < 2^8
]
```

Look up (a, b, c) to prove c = a + b.

### 5.3 Table Compression Techniques

**Sparse Tables**: Only include "interesting" values
**Layered Tables**: Large tables decomposed into combinations of small tables
**Shared Tables**: Multiple circuits share the same tables

## Lesson 7: Performance Analysis

### 7.1 Cost Comparison

**Traditional Method vs Lookup**:

| Operation | Traditional Gates | Lookup Cost | Improvement |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------|-------------|
| 16-bit range check | 16 | 1 | 16x |
| 32-bit AND | 32 | 1 | 32x |
| Division | ~100 | 1 | 100x |

### 7.2 Table Size Trade-offs

**Larger Tables**:
- Support more operations
- Increased trusted setup cost
- Increased memory requirements

**Smaller Tables**:
- Limited operation range
- May require multiple lookups

### 7.3 Real Performance Data

On modern hardware:
- Table precomputation: One-time cost
- Lookup proof generation: Sub-linear growth
- Verification time: Constant level
